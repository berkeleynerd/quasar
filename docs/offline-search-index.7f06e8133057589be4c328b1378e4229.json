[{"body":"At TechCo we use the command line every day along with our favorite IDE, Goland. In this section we will help you install and configure an opinionated set of tools enabling a modern and effective command line workflow to augment the capabilities of your IDE. There are certainly other terminals, shells, and IDEs out there to choose from but we think the options presented here make the most sense for experienced Windows users dedicated to the platform.\nIn addition to enabling efficient workflows, these command line tools also make following along with a guide like this one a lot simpler. There is nothing more frustrating than referring to dozens of screenshots filled with red markup and yellow highlights that inevitably go a little more out-of-date with each UI update.\n{% hint style=“info” %} The remainder of this guide assumes you have Windows Terminal and Winget installed and that you are using PowerShell to run the commands provided throughout. {% endhint %}\n{% hint style=“info” %} Windows Terminal and Winget are installed by default with Windows 11! {% endhint %}\nWindows terminal We are going to be spending a lot of time on the command line so before we do anything else let’s first install Windows Terminal via the Microsoft Store app. It is lightyears ahead of the venerable windows console and can be customized to your heart’s content.\nInstall Windows Terminal\nWinget We are also going to need a package manager. What is a package manager you ask? Well, it’s an application you use from the command line to install, upgrade, and remove applications. If you have heard of chocolatey it’s like that but made by Microsoft. If you come from the Mac world you can think of it as a Windows version of homebrew.\nTo install winget browse to its release page on GitHub, download the latest .msixbundle file, then double-click it. Make sure the version you download is marked latest release and isn’t an old or preview release.\nDownload WinGet\n{% hint style=“info” %} You can update any app installed with winget to the latest version with the command winget upgrade \u003cpackage\u003e\nThe command winget list \u003cpackage\u003e will report the version currently installed and whether an upgrade is available. You can also run winget list without specifying a package to check if upgrades are available for any installed package. {% endhint %}\nPowerShell Finally, we need to decide on a shell to use within our terminal environment. Since this guide assumes you are using Windows we will stick with Microsoft’s default PowerShell environment for now. Other options available include Microsoft’s Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and the version of the classic Linux BASH shell installed along with Git. These other options all involve additional setup, however, and come with various limitations and caveats in addition to the advantages they provide in some scenarios.\nUpdate PowerShell An older version of PowerShell called, confusingly, Windows PowerShell is included by default when Windows is installed and can not be upgraded or uninstalled. It is also locked-down by default as it is intended for system administration. You can use this version if you prefer but to do so and follow along with this guide you will need to loosen these restrictions for the current user by executing the command Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser\nTo use the latest release version of PowerShell you can install it using winget :\nwinget install Microsoft.PowerShell Update the default PowerShell profile While there are some amazingly functional and visually appealing ways to customize your PowerShell prompt we are going to simply update ours using a small script that will display the Git branch associated with the current directory if it is under source control. This will help us determine at a glance if we are working in the correct branch. Invoke-WebRequest -Uri \"https://git.io/JXGyz\" -OutFile $PROFILE Shell and terminal defaults To load the latest version of PowerShell by default and / or configure Windows Terminal as your default terminal application navigate to the _Settings _tab in Windows Terminal using the shortcut Ctrl-, and set the following values:\n![](../.gitbook/assets/WindowsTerminal-Defaults.png)\n","categories":"","description":"in the beginning was the command line ...\n","excerpt":"in the beginning was the command line ...\n","ref":"/quasar/dev-environment/","tags":"","title":"Command line"},{"body":" This is a placeholder page that shows you how to use this template site.\n The Overview is where your users find out about your project. Depending on the size of your docset, you can have a separate overview page (like this one) or put your overview contents in the Documentation landing page (like in the Docsy User Guide).\nTry answering these questions for your user in this page:\nWhat is it? Introduce your project, including what it does or lets you do, why you would use it, and its primary goal (and how it achieves it).

What are the benefits of using it?\n  What is it not good for?: For example, point out situations that might intuitively seem suited for your project, but aren’t for some reason. Also mention known limitations, scaling issues, or anything else that might let your users know if the project is not for them.\n  What is it not yet good for?: Highlight any useful features that are coming soon.\n  Where should I go next?

Use these to choose your core tasks. Each granular use case (enable x, configure y) should have a corresponding tasks page or tasks page section.

Think of your tasks pages as a cookbook with different procedures your users can combine to create something more substantial.\nYou can give each task a page, or you can group related tasks together in a page, such as tasks related to a particular feature. As well as grouping related tasks in single pages, you can also group task pages in nested folders with an index page as an overview, as seen in this example site. Or if you have a small docset like the Docsy User Guide with no Tutorials or Concepts pages, consider adding your feature-specific pages at the top level of your docs rather than in a Tasks section.\nEach task should give the user\n The prerequisites for this task, if any (this can be specified at the top of a multi-task page if they’re the same for all the page’s tasks. “All these tasks assume that you understand….and that you have already….\").

You can use the guidelines “as is” or adapt them with your own instructions: for example, other deployment options, information about your doc project’s file structure, project-specific review guidelines, versioning guidelines, or any other information your users might find useful when updating your site. Kubeflow has a great example.\nDon’t forget to link to your own doc repo rather than our example site! Also make sure users can find these guidelines from your doc repo README: either add them there and link to them from this page, add them here and link to them from the README, or include them in both locations.\n We use Hugo to format and generate our website, the Docsy theme for styling and site structure, and Netlify to manage the deployment of the site. Hugo is an open-source static site generator that provides us with templates, content organisation in a standard directory structure, and a website generation engine. You write the pages in Markdown (or HTML if you want), and Hugo wraps them up into a website.\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult GitHub Help for more information on using pull requests.\nQuick start with Netlify Here’s a quick guide to updating the docs. It assumes you’re familiar with the GitHub workflow and you’re happy to use the automated preview of your doc updates:\n Fork the Goldydocs repo on GitHub. Make your changes and send a pull request (PR). If you’re not yet ready for a review, add “WIP” to the PR name to indicate it’s a work in progress. (Don’t add the Hugo property “draft = true” to the page front matter, because that prevents the auto-deployment of the content preview described in the next point.) Wait for the automated PR workflow to do some checks. When it’s ready, you should see a comment like this: deploy/netlify — Deploy preview ready! Click Details to the right of “Deploy preview ready” to see a preview of your updates. Continue updating your doc and pushing your changes until you’re happy with the content. When you’re ready for a review, add a comment to the PR, and remove any “WIP” markers.  Updating a single page If you’ve just spotted something you’d like to change while using the docs, Docsy has a shortcut for you:\n Click Edit this page in the top right hand corner of the page. If you don’t already have an up to date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one - click Fork this repository and propose changes or Update your Fork to get an up to date version of the project to edit. The appropriate page in your fork is displayed in edit mode. Follow the rest of the Quick start with Netlify process above to make, preview, and propose your changes.  Previewing your changes locally If you want to run your own local Hugo server to preview your changes as you work:\n  Follow the instructions in Getting started to install Hugo and any other tools you need. You’ll need at least Hugo version 0.45 (we recommend using the most recent available version), and it must be the extended version, which supports SCSS.\n  Fork the Goldydocs repo repo into your own project, then create a local copy using git clone. Don’t forget to use --recurse-submodules or you won’t pull down some of the code you need to generate a working site.\ngit clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/google/docsy-example.git   Run hugo server in the site root directory. By default your site will be available at http://localhost:1313/. Now that you’re serving your site locally, Hugo will watch for changes to the content and automatically refresh your site.\n  Continue with the usual GitHub workflow to edit files, commit them, push the changes up to your fork, and create a pull request.\n  Creating an issue If you’ve found a problem in the docs, but you’re not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in the Goldydocs repo. You can also create an issue about a specific page by clicking the Create Issue button in the top right hand corner of the page.\nUseful resources  [Docsy user guide](wherever it goes): All about Docsy, including how it manages navigation, look and feel, and multi-language support.

Furthermore, it’s hard to know exactly where to start on this journey and how to stay on the optimal path through the multitude of confluence pages, READMEs, FAQs, blog posts, and third-party documentation you encounter along the way.\nIn this guide we attempt to provide just such a starting point for developers new to CCP’s domain service architecture and its long list of technologies. Our goal is to help you navigate step-by-step past each technological challenge, summarize the essential knowledge you need to keep going, and point out important internal and external resources you will want to circle back to later once you are well on your way to delivering real business and gameplay value for both CCP and its players alike.\nSetting expectations Like many other teams at CCP, TechCo maintains an official working agreement designed to facilitate a positive and productive working relationship between its staff and other developers throughout the company. This is an important document and you should read it in its entirety and bookmark it to refer to later. In fact, many of the topics we will consider in this guide are sourced directly from the working agreement and expanded on to add clarity, detail, and substance.\nWhere to find help If you have questions or run into issues while following along with this guide feel free to ask us for help on Slack.

Go is a modern, statically typed, general purpose programming language developed by Google to create reliable and efficient network applications. It’s syntax is similar to C and it attempts to combine the high-performance of a low-level language like C with the productivity and convenience of high-level languages like Python. It features garbage collection, fast build times, type inference, and first-class support for “goroutines”, lightweight coroutines that lend themselves to building highly concurrent network services. Go was open-sourced by Google in 2012.\nGo is popular because it made a number of design choices intended to make it easy to learn and the systems produced using it easy to maintain. To this end …\n Go has only 25 keywords and useful systems can be built using just the standard library which itself is performant and capable.  Go compiles very quickly enabling rapid feedback and tight developer iteration loops. Go offers a backward compatibility promise. Go’s designers have promised that Go code written 5 years ago will still build. With respect to testing, benchmarking, linting, and deployment GO’S tooling is both built-in and first class.  In other words, with Go you can write code and when you come back to it a year or two later it will still build and everything will still make sense.\nAnother compelling reason to choose Go is that, per the working agreement, TTC only provides support for projects written in Go. While we would love to support Python, C#, and even Elixir (for some of us, especially Elixir!) we simply don’t have the time, expertise, and staff to support them, their tooling, their best practices, and their ecosystems.\nInstall Go To install Go launch Windows Terminal and use winget like so :\nwinget install GoLang.Go # restart shell to reload PATH You often need to restart Windows Terminal after installing a new command line utility so that PowerShell will pick up changes to the $ENV:PATH variable. Once Windows Terminal has been restarted execute the following command to insure everything is working as expected :\ngo version If all went well you should see output that looks something like the following :\n% go version go version go1.17.3 windows/amd64 {% hint style=“info” %} You have access to both system and user environment variables from the command line. Here are a few that often come in handy…\n$ENV:USERPROFILE Your user profile folder.\n$ENV:TEMP Folder for temporary files. \n$ENV:PATH List of locations searched for executable files.\n$PROFILE Path to script that executes when you open a shell. {% endhint %}\n{% embed url=“https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=446E-r0rXHI\" %} for a quick run-down kick-back and watch 100 seconds of go {% endembed %}\nGo modules Go modules aim to help solve problems related to dependency management, version selection, and reproducible builds.\nAdding module support to a project is pretty straightforward. Select any folder as the root of the module and execute go mod init \u003cmodulepath\u003e\nThis process generates a go.mod file containing the module’s path, Go version, and list of its dependencies. The go.mod file also often contains a URL indicating where the code for the module is available. This is often a reference to the project’s repository on github.com. To learn more about modules check out the documentation. If no \u003cmodulepath\u003e is specified go mod init will infer it based on the the name of the current folder. Here is an example of this process executed from the command line : mkdir my-project cd my-project go mod init my-project A simple go.mod file will look something like this :\nmodule my-project go 1.17 The go command’s built-in documentation provides an overview of all available go mod and other go \u003csubcommand\u003e subcommands which you can access using go help from the command line like so : go help mod go help mod init {% hint style=“info” %} Go 1.11 introduced module support which later became the default in version 1.16. The use of GOPATH is no longer recommended. For more information on how to use GOPATH if you run across it in the wild visit this page. {% endhint %}\nGodoc Another quality of life feature of Go is its documentation.
