At TechCo we use the command-line every day along with our favorite IDE, Goland. In this section we will help you install and configure an opinionated set of tools enabling a modern and effective command line workflow to augment the capabilities of your IDE. There are certainly other terminals, shells, and IDEs out there to choose from but we think the options presented here make the most sense for experienced Windows users dedicated to the platform.

In addition to enabling efficient workflows, these command line tools also make following along with a guide like this one a lot simpler. There is nothing more frustrating than referring to dozens of screenshots filled with red markup and yellow highlights that inevitably go a little more out-of-date with each UI update.
